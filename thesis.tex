Reddit is \emph{the front page of the internet}, a slogan the company has coined and rightfully lived up to. It is a website which brings together members of all communities in a similar style to a typical forum but with much more structure and a lot more traffic. Due to the open nature of reddit, it generates a large amount of traffic, averaging over 200 million unique visitors a month. With such traffic screams the demand for data analysis through a human-interpretable medium which this thesis covers. Data analysis on reddit has been done before however this thesis focuses on bringing the data gathered in to a easily consumable format. We will explore the implementation and results of querying the reddit API, generating aggregate statistics, querying large data dumps of historic reddit data with \emph{Google BigQuery} and the use of unsupervised machine learning to draw powerful conclusions.

Work on this thesis was widely facilitated with help from Dr. Ramon Lawrence through weekly meetings where ideas and progress were discussed extensively. It is also important to acknowledge Dr. Jeff Andrews for his support in advising on machine learning techniques which were implemented as described later.

To best understand this thesis and the work done, it is necessary to first be introduced to the relevant technologies and key terms which will be heavily referenced and built upon.

\section{Reddit}
A type of online community where users vote on content.

\subsection{Overview}
Reddit is a a news and entertainment website whose content is sustained by members of the community. Users submit text posts or direct links similar to a typical forum setting. Registered users can vote on submissions bringing order to the posts yielding an ordered online bulletin board. Furthermore, what makes Reddit unique is that content is subsectioned into different areas of interest called ``subreddits''. Some of the top subreddits include \textit{movies}, \textit{funny}, \textit{AskReddit}, \textit{food} and \textit{news}. As of March 3rd, 2016 Reddit had 231,625,384 unique users a month viewing a total of 7,517,661,034 pages. The company was founded 10 years ago and has quickly become the most central place on the internet to partake in conversation or consume a wide array of content.

\subsection{History}
The company was founded by two new graduates of the \textit{University of Virginia}, Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian, in June 2005 \citep{Guardian}. After a couple years of growth, Reddit's traffic exploded and the service went viral. The creators were quick to release Reddit Gold, which offered new features and usability improvements providing the company with a primary source of income.

\subsection{Community}
Reddit thrives on its open nature and diverse content fully generated by the community \citep{Atlantic}. The demographics Reddit serves allows for a wide range of subject areas thus having the ability for smaller communities to digest their niche content. Subreddits provide a very unique opportunity by raising attention and fostering discussion that may not be seen as mainstream and covered by other news or entertainment mediums.\\
Reddit as a company and as a community has been known for several philanthropic projects both short and long term. A few of notable efforts are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item{Users donated \$185,356 to Direct Relief for Haiti after the earthquake that struck the country in January 2010}
\item{Reddit donates 10\% of it's yearly annual ad revenue to non-profits voted upon by its users \citep{RedditBlog}}
\item{Members from Reddit donated over \$600,000 to DonorsChoose in support of Stephen Colbert's March to Keep Fear Alive \citep{DonorsChoose}}
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Technical Stack}
Rally is a project that explores many different types of data access, processing techniques and display forms. The technical stack is broken in to components as follows.
