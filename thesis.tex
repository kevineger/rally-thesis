Reddit is \emph{the front page of the internet}, a slogan the company has coined and rightfully lived up to. It is a website which brings together members of all communities in a similar style to a typical forum but with much more structure and a lot more traffic. Due to the open nature of reddit, it generates a large amount of traffic, averaging over 200 million unique visitors a month. With such traffic screams the demand for data analysis through a human-interpretable medium which this thesis covers. Data analysis on reddit has been done before however this thesis focuses on bringing the data gathered in to a easily consumable format. We will explore the implementation and results of querying the reddit API, generating aggregate statistics, querying large data dumps of historic reddit data with \emph{Google BigQuery} and the use of unsupervised machine learning to draw powerful conclusions.

\chapter{Acknowledgements}      % Optional
Work on this thesis was widely facilitated with help from Dr. Ramon Lawrence through weekly meetings where ideas and progress were discussed extensively. It is also important to acknowledge Dr. Jeff Andrews for his support in advising on machine learning techniques which were implemented as described later.
